- Optimized for large conversations (tested with 10K+ messages)
- Framework agnostic (works with any backend)
- Zero dependencies on specific chat services

**Performance benchmarks:**

- Sub-100ms initialization

**Real-world usage:**
Already being used in production by customer support platforms, educational apps, and AI assistants.

The package includes comprehensive examples showing everything from basic setup to advanced theming and file handling.

Would love to get feedback from the community!
