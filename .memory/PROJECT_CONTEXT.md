# Project Context

## Project Overview
This is the centralized progress tracking system setup for managing development context across multiple AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).

## Technologies Used
- Claude Code with MCP servers
- MCP Memory Keeper for persistent context
- Standardized .memory/ directory structure

## Architecture
- `.memory/` directory for cross-tool context
- JSON progress tracking for machine reading
- Markdown files for human-readable context
- MCP Memory Keeper for Claude Code sessions

## Current Phase
Setting up centralized progress tracking system
