# Flutter Gen AI Chat UI Example

This project demonstrates how to use the Flutter Gen AI Chat UI package to build AI chat interfaces in Flutter.

## Example Structure

The example contains:

1. **Simple Example (main.dart)**: 
   - A minimal implementation showing the core features
   - Demonstrates the always-visible send button
   - Shows welcome messages and example questions

2. **Comprehensive Example (comprehensive/)**:
   - Advanced implementation with streaming text
   - Theme switching (dark/light mode)
   - Markdown support with code blocks
   - Custom styling options
   - Animation controls

## Running the Example

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the example directory
3. Run the example:

```bash
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
